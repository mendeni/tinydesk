"""make_release.py - package the built firmware and programs for people without a toolchain.

Two editions, like a desktop and a server install of an operating system:

    TinyDesk Desktop   the windowed desktop with TinyDesk Shell in its Terminal
    TinyDesk Shell     the shell on its own, on the board's console

Run it after building the ESP-IDF projects (ports/esp32c6, ports/esp32,
ports/esp32-4mb, and for the shell edition third_party/tdsh and
third_party/tdsh/projects/esp32). For each board it merges what
`idf.py flash` writes (read from build/flash_args) into one "factory"
image, and writes a flat set of files, as they are attached to a GitHub
release:

    dist/tinydesk-<version>/
        tinydesk-<edition>-<version>-<board>-factory.bin   esptool, offset 0x0
        manifest-<edition>-<board>.json                   ESP Web Tools, one per board
        tinydesk-<edition>-<version>-<board>-app.bin       the app alone, for updates
        update-<edition>-<board>.json                     the update feed boards read
                                                           (boards with two app slots)
        tinydesk-desktop-linux-x86_64.tar.gz ...          PC programs (--host-*)
        SHA256SUMS.txt, README.txt

With --site DIR it also fills the web installer of a documentation site
(DIR/install/): the manifests, firmware/ with the images and downloads/
with the PC programs. The installer site is kept outside this repository;
see its README.

    python tools/make_release.py [--site ../tinydesk-site/site] [--out dist] [--allow-board-conf]
        [--host-linux-desktop build/tinydesk] [--host-linux-shell build-shell/tdsh_host]
        [--host-windows-desktop build/tinydesk.exe] [--host-windows-shell build-shell/tdsh_host.exe]

The shell edition is optional: boards whose build is missing are left out
(with a note). Needs esptool (in the ESP-IDF Python environment; `pip
install esptool` otherwise).
